                <div class="article-text advanced-list" style="border: none; height: auto; padding: 20px; flex-direction: column; font-weight: 530;">
                    <h3>Outer Anatomy:</h3>
                    <p>Rats have a <b>compact</b> and <b>agile</b> body, typically measuring around 9-11 inches in length, excluding the tail. They possess a well-developed <b>muscular system</b> that enables them to move swiftly and navigate their environment with ease. Their bodies are covered in <b>fur</b>, which can vary in color, texture, and pattern depending on the species. The fur serves as protection, insulation, and camouflage.</p>
                    <p>The head of a rat is characterized by a pointed snout housing sharp and continuously growing <b>incisors</b>. These incisors are specialized for gnawing and chewing, allowing rats to explore their surroundings and obtain food. They also possess small, rounded <b>ears</b> that provide excellent hearing capabilities. Rats have a pair of bright, observant <b>eyes</b> that facilitate visual perception, helping them detect movements and navigate in low-light conditions.</p>
                    <p>Rats have a long, slender <b>tail</b> that is typically longer than their body length. The tail serves various functions, including balance, communication, and thermoregulation. It aids in maintaining stability during rapid movements and acts as a counterbalance when climbing or leaping. The tail is devoid of fur and covered in scales, providing a tactile sense that aids in sensory perception.</p>

                <div class="article-text advanced-list" style="border: none; height: auto; padding: 20px; flex-direction: column; font-weight: 530;">
                    <h3>Inner Anatomy:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The inner anatomy of rats reveals intricate structures and systems that contribute to their overall physiological function and well-being. Like other mammals, rats have a highly organized internal body plan, with organs and systems working in harmony.</p>
                        <li>The skeletal system of rats consists of a framework of bones that provide support, protection, and mobility. The skull protects the brain, while the vertebral column (<b>spine</b>) provides structural support and houses the <b>spinal cord</b>. Rats possess four limbs with various bones, enabling them to move and manipulate objects.</p>
                        <li>Rats have a well-developed circulatory system, consisting of the <b>heart</b>, <b>blood vessels</b>, and <b>blood</b>. The heart pumps oxygenated blood to all parts of the body, delivering nutrients and removing waste products. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins return deoxygenated blood back to the heart.</p>
                        <li>The respiratory system of rats allows for efficient gas exchange. They have a pair of <b>lungs</b>, where oxygen from the air is absorbed and carbon dioxide is expelled. Rats breathe through their nostrils and possess a complex network of air passages that facilitate the exchange of gases.</p>
                        <li>Rats have a highly developed digestive system to process food and extract nutrients. Their digestive tract consists of the <b>mouth</b>, <b>esophagus</b>, <b>stomach</b>, <b>small intestine</b>, and <b>large intestine</b>. The specialized structure of their <b>teeth</b> and the presence of multiple digestive <b>enzymes</b> aid in the breakdown of food for efficient nutrient absorption.</p>
                        <li>The nervous system of rats is complex and plays a crucial role in their sensory perception, coordination, and behavior. Rats have a well-developed <b>brain</b> that controls various bodily functions and behaviors. Their sensory organs, including the <b>eyes</b>, <b>ears</b>, and <b>nose</b>, gather information from the environment, which is processed by the brain.</p>

                    Rat society is not characterized by constant fighting or aggression. In healthy colonies, rats work together and have a cooperative dynamic. They engage in affectionate grooming rituals and use dominant behaviors as a means to establish social bonds and understand each other better. Rats rely on their social structure for maintaining order and responding to threats or disturbances. When their social structure is disrupted, colonies can become agitated and frantic as they try to restore balance
